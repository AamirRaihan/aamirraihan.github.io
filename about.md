<img class="profile-picture" src="../Profile.jpg">

Hi! I am a 2<sup>nd</sup> year master student of Computer Engineering at The University of British Columbia, Vancouver. I am fortunate to be advised by [Tor Aamodt](https://www.ece.ubc.ca/~aamodt/). 

Previously, I received my undergraduate degree from Indian Institute of Technology (BHU), Varanasi in 2015. After graduation I worked for two years at NXP semiconductor(Former Freescale Semiconductor).

## Research Interest

My research interest spans at the intersection of systems and machine learning. I am currently working on co-designing efficient algorithms, software infrastructure and hardware systems for machine learning.

## Publications

1. [Modeling Deep Learning Accelerator Enabled GPUs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08309)
2. [A Flexible Scalable Hardware Architecture for Radial Basis Function Neural Network](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7031785?reload=true)
