# Personal Website 

The site is developed using the following jekyll themes:
* [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) is an unassuming [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme that places content first by tucking away navigation in a hidden drawer. It's based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler.
* [Researcher](https://github.com/ankitsultana/researcher) is a clean, single column, monospace resume template built for jekyll.
